**UAVDT Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 77819 images with 835879 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *car*, *vehicle*, *truck*, and other: *bus*.

Images in the UAVDT dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 326 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (53676 images) and *train* (24143 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 camera views: ***front view*** (23601 images), ***side view*** (17672 images), and ***bird view*** (10737 images), or into 3 out of views: ***no out*** (725059 objects), ***medium out*** (37089 objects), and ***small out*** (36647 objects), or into 3 flying altitudes: ***medium alt*** (24059 images), ***low alt*** (14644 images), and ***high alt*** (2032 images), or into 3 occlusions types: ***no occlusion*** (715470 objects), ***small occlusion*** (64004 objects), and ***medium occlusion*** (10025 objects), or into 3 weather conditions: ***daylight*** (24055 images), ***night*** (11501 images), and ***fog*** (5179 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***sequence*** tag, labels marked with ***target id*** and ***long term*** tags. Explore its in Supervisely labelling tool. The dataset was released in 2018 by the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, Harbin Institute of Technology, China, and The University of Texas at San Antonio, USA.
